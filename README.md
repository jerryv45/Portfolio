# Portfolio // Master Branch

This project uses Vue 3 and TailwindCSS mainly, this is the master page where all updates are pushed, no working production versions will be located here. 

However, if you'd like to clone the project and test it, you can run

```sh
npm run dev
```

In order to deploy to production refer to the gh-pages branch here: [gh-pages](https://github.com/jerryv45/Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/README.md)
